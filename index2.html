    <p><i><u><b>A Jaguar trainer aircraft of the Indian Air Force crashed during a routine training mission in Rajasthan's Churu district on Wednesday afternoon, resulting in the death of both pilots on board.</b></u></i></p> 
    <p><i>An IAF Jaguar Trainer aircraft met with an accident during a routine training mission and crashed near Churu in Rajasthan, today. Both pilots sustained fatal injuries in the accident. No damage to any civil property has been reported,” the IAF said in a statement.</i></p>
    <p><i>IAF deeply regrets the loss of lives and stands firmly with the bereaved families in this time of grief,” the IAF said, adding that a court of inquiry has been constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident.</i></p>
    <p><i>The aircraft crashed in an agriculture field in Bhanoda village around 1.25 pm, SHO Rajaldesar Kamlessh told news agency PTI.</i></p>
    <p><br><br><b><u>Past crashes</u></b> <br><br><i> Three months earlier, in April, a similar incident occurred when a two-seater Jaguar aircraft belonging to the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed shortly after taking off from Jamnagar Airfield during a night mission.
     The IAF reported that the pilots experienced a technical malfunction mid-flight and ejected in an effort to prevent damage to the airfield and surrounding populated areas.<br><br> Tragically, one of the pilots, Siddharth Yadav, succumbed to injuries sustained during the ejection, while the other pilot sustained injuries in the incident.
     In March 2025, an Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jet crashed in the Panchkula district of Haryana during a routine training sortie on a Friday.<br><br>The IAF reported that the pilot experienced a system malfunction and successfully steered the aircraft away from populated areas before ejecting safely.
     "The pilot manoeuvred the aircraft away from any habitation on the ground before ejecting safely. An inquiry has been ordered by the IAF to ascertain the cause of the accident," the air force stated.<br><br> In February, a twin-seater Mirage 2000 crashed near Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh during a routine training sortie. Both pilots managed to eject safely before the crash.
     In another incident in November 2024, a MiG-29 fighter jet crashed into a field near Agra, Uttar Pradesh, due to a technical fault during a training sortie. The pilot safely ejected in that case as well.

    <p><i><u><b>Shimla, The Kailash Yatra is set to commence from July 15 in Himachal Pradesh's Kinnaur district, officials on Wednesday said.</b></u>
     The district administration has mandated registration forms and medical certificates for all pilgrims for the yatra, which will continue till August 30, they said.<br><br>A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Kalpa Sub-Divisional Magistrate Amit Kaltaik during which he reviewed the preparations for the yatra.
     Kaltaik said that the yatra would commence from Tangling village, while the alternative Purbani Kanda route will be considered only after evaluating the current condition.
     <br><br>The SDM said that a base camp would be established at Malling Khatta in Tangling, where all pilgrims must undergo a mandatory medical check-up.
     Only those who complete the medical check-up and pay a green fee of ₹200 will be allowed to proceed, he added.
     altaik said an online registration will be available from July 11 to facilitate the process, while offline registration services will begin in Tangling village on July 14.
     <br><br>The SDM also ordered the formation of a Quick Response Team to handle any emergency situations that may arise.
     He emphasized maintaining proper cleanliness and hygiene during the pilgrimage and urged pilgrims to act responsibly to uphold the sanctity of the yatra.
     altaik instructed the Health Department to ensure that medical facilities are available at multiple points along the route.
     The local panchayat stakeholders have been asked to extend full cooperation to the administration.
     Basic amenities such as public toilets, solar lighting, clean drinking water, resting shelters, oxygen cylinders and medical support will be available in a timely manner at various locations," the SDM said.
     "For the health and safety of pilgrims, Ganesh Park will be equipped with large oxygen cylinders and a medical officer, while Parvati Cave will have a paramedical team and smaller oxygen cylinders" he added.

    <br><br>n the city, areas like Salt Lake, Howrah, and central Kolkata reported waterlogging due to relentless overnight showers. Office-goers and students waded through submerged streets, while public transport, including buses and autos, was hampered across multiple routesKolkata wasn’t alone in bearing the brunt.

    In stark contrast, Himachal Pradesh is reeling under the weight of relentless monsoon devastation. With 203.2 mm of rain recorded between June 1 and July 8 — significantly above normal — flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts have become routine. According to the State Emergency Operation Centre, nearly 200 roads, including 150 in Mandi alone, are still blocked. Hundreds of transformers and water supply schemes remain affected, and close to 450 people are taking shelter in relief camps as the state braces for more rain.

    Residents of the state have expressed mounting concern over reckless hill cutting for road projects, particularly by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). They blame such activities for weakening slopes and triggering landslides
    Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, who conducted an inspection along the under-construction Shoghi-Dhalli highway, assured people that their grievances will be raised with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. "It’s not just a financial loss but an emotional and social setback," he said, referring to the collapse of homes

        The ‘Bharat bandh’ will likely affect public services, and workers from both formal and organised sectors are making preparations for the strike, according to the forum.
        <br><br><b><u>Here are 10 key points on Bharat bandh today</u></b>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li class="a1"><i>According to All India Trade Union Congress member Amarjeet Kaur, over 25 crore workers from across different sectors, including farmers and rural workers, will participate in the strike.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i>The workers participating in the strikes are employed in sectors including banking, insurance, postal, coal mining, and highway and construction.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i>A joint forum of 10 central trade unions called for the strike, appealing to the labour force to make it “a grand success.”</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i>The forum said that the strike has been called in opposition to the “anti-worker”, “anti-farmer”, and “anti-national pro-corporate policies” of the Union Government.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i> Employees from the banking sector will join the Bharat Bandh, an association of bank employees told PTI. While no banking holiday has been announced, this could disrupt banking services across the country. In addition to this, the insurance sector might also join the strike, the Bengal Provincial Bank Employees Association said.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i> Schools and colleges are expected to function normally, with educational institutions not being notified of any holiday due to Bharat Bandh.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i>Power services could also be affected during the strike owing to 27 lakh workers from the sector participating in the Bharat Bandh, according to a PTI report.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i> While there might be delays in railway operations, train services will also operate as scheduled, with no official announcement about the Bharat Bandh being made.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i>Some of the demands made by the trade unions include addressing unemployment, increasing days and remuneration under MGNREGA, and creation of more jobs. The forum has also lodged its opposition to the four new labour codes, which it says aim to dismantle collective bargaining and increase working hours.</i></li>
            <li class="a1"><i> The unions have also accused the government of favouring employers citing “ease of doing business”. The statement released by the forum alleges that the new labour codes shield employers from accountability.</i></li>

    <p><i><b><u>Gujarat bridge collapse: 9 dead, chief minister Bhupendra Patel orders probe</u></b>
        At least nine people were killed as five vehicles plunged into the Mahisagar River during the morning rush hour due to the collapse of a portion of a bridge at Padra in Vadodara district on Wednesday. Visuals of a tanker hanging from the bridge went viral on social media. Officials said two trucks, an SUV, a pickup van, and an auto-rickshaw fell into the river
        <br><br><img align="right" src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/09/550x309/Rescue-operation-underway-after-vehicles-fell-into_1752046862599.jpg" alt="">
        Vadodara (rural) police superintendent Rohan Anand said nine bodies have been recovered so far, and nine-10 people were rescued. Officials feared the death toll could rise as the rescue and search operations continued.
        Vadodara district administration officials, police, fire brigade teams, and residents joined the rescue operations. Five people were rescued immediately and rushed to hospitals.
        <br><br>Cranes were deployed to retrieve submerged vehicles as search efforts continued. An official said that the bridge’s dilapidated condition and maintenance issues could have led to the incident.
     Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel ordered an investigation into the collapse as a team of technical experts was dispatched to the site. “I have directed the Roads and Buildings Department to conduct an immediate investigation into this accident. ...I have instructed a team comprising the Chief Engineer - Design, Chief Engineer - South Gujarat, and two private engineers specialising in bridge construction to urgently reach the site, investigate the reasons for the bridge collapse, and submit a preliminary report on technical aspects,” he wrote on social media.
     He said the collapse of one of the Gambhira Bridge’s 23 spans caused the incident. “I have spoken with the Vadodara Collector to ensure immediate treatment arrangements for the injured and have instructed that priority be given to these measures.”
     <br><br>He said rescue and relief operations were underway and that the local municipality and Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade teams, equipped with boats and divers, were at the site. Patel said a National Disaster Response Force team has also reached the site and joined the rescue efforts.
     The bridge, constructed in 1985, served as a critical link between the Anand and Vadodara districts. In October 2022, a bridge collapse in Gujarat’s Morbi left at least 135 people dead.

    Nearly a month after the deadly Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India's top air accident investigation body told a parliamentary panel that it has yet to submit a preliminary report on the incident.
    <br>The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) informed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture that although an initial report was due within 30 days of the June 12 incident, no report has been submitted yet, PTI reported.
    <br><br>The preliminary report due will offer the first official explanation for the crash of the Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner in Ahmedabad on June 12, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board.
 The report by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau will provide reasons for the accident and is based on an examination of data extracted from the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder, according to people familiar with the process, who asked not to be identified, discussing confidential information.
 Members of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) raised serious concerns over aviation safety following the Air India Flight AI-171 crash in Ahmedabad and the sudden surge in flight fares from Srinagar to other cities after the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, according to sources.
<br><br>
 A day-long meeting of a parliamentary committee on safety in the aviation sector took place on Wednesday, with members questioning official agencies and private airlines over safety standards being followed by them.

<h2 id="delta"><b>Delta Flight Emergency Landing Due to Lithium Battery Fire</b></h2>
<p><i>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after a battery fire onboard a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 flying from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale prompted an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, Monday morning.
    <br><br>
    Flight 1334 was flying with 191 people onboard when the crew reported smoke in the cabin, according to the FAA.
    <br><br>
    “Flight attendants worked quickly to extinguish a probable burning personal battery belonging to a customer while pilots followed procedures to safely divert the flight,” a Delta spokesperson said in a statement.
    The FAA allows most consumer personal electronic devices with lithium-ion batteries in checked and carry-on luggage. However, spare batteries are only allowed in bags passengers take into the cabin with them.
    <br><br>
    “The backpack has been contained. We think it was a lithium battery that caused the smoke and the fire,” the pilot radioed to firefighters on the ground at the Fort Myers airport, according to a recording by LiveATC.net. “It’s in a containment bag. No smoke in the cabin at this point. No active fire.”
    <br><br>
    Planes carry fireproof containment bags where burning batteries can be isolated until landing.
    <br><br>
    No injuries were reported, according to the airline.
    <br><br>
    “We appreciate the quick work and actions by our people to follow their training, and we apologize to our customers for the delay in their travels,” the Delta spokesperson said

<h2 id="india"><b><u>India Urges Global Probe into Maritime Disasters</u></mark></b></h2>
<p><i>
    India on Wednesday highlighted recent maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters and urged the International Maritime Organization to review all such incidents, according to an official statement.
    <br><br>
    Shipping secretary TK Ramachandran, while participating in the 134th session of the Council of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), said recent maritime incidents caused by undeclared hazardous cargoes have raised serious safety concerns.
    <br><br>
    "India delivered a strong and principled statement addressing recent maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters," the statement said.
    <br><br>
    India urged the IMO to undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all such incidents involving container ships, it added
    <br><br>
    Citing the proactive role of the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard in ensuring the safety of life at sea, the statement said India called for urgent enhancements in the safety framework for container shipping.
    <br><br>
    "The Indian statement underscored the need to reinforce international protocols related to packaging, declaration, stowage, and monitoring of lithium-ion batteries and IMDG cargo," it noted.
    <br><br>
    According to the statement, India proposed the establishment of IMO-led investigations into such incidents to help build global best practices, improve standardisation, and strengthen operational norms that ensure the safety and security of container ship operations across the world.
    <br><br>
    India proudly shared the remarkable achievement of a 650 per cent increase in the number of Indian women seafarers, showcasing the country's commitment to creating equal opportunities in the maritime sector
    <br><br>
    The country has witnessed serious maritime incidents along its coastline that exposed vulnerabilities in the current emergency response framework.
    <br><br>
    The sinking of the container ship MSC ELSA 3 in May 2025 and the major fire and explosion of the container ship WAN HAI 503 in June 2025, off the coast of Kerala, led to the loss of several containers in the waters and the release of hazardous cargo and significant environmental risk.

<p><i>
    Bangladesh must immediately end crackdown against protesters 
Bangladesh is witnessing the deadliest crackdown against protesters in the country’s post-independence history. The heavy-handed response from the authorities has resulted in the deaths of more than 197 students, journalists, and bystanders, and injured thousands since 15 July 2024 as the crackdown escalated. Sign the petition now and demand that the government of Bangladesh urgently end this repression.
<br><br>
<u><b>What’s the problem? </b></u>
Since 1 July 2024, university level students have launched protests to demand reforms in the existing quota-system which reserves 30% of government jobs for descendants of independence war veterans claiming that it unjustly favours supporters of the ruling party.
<br><br>
The protests met with a severe crackdown from the authorities and the ensued violence has resulted in the deaths of more than 197 people, with 75 deaths reported in one day, thousands more people injured and more than 2,500 believed to have been arrested.  
<br><br>
Amnesty International’s investigations show that security forces responded to the protests with unlawful, and sometimes lethal, force. The Bangladesh authorities also failed to prevent attacks against protesters allegedly carried out by members of the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group affiliated with the ruling party. The authorities also put a “shoot on sight” curfew, nationwide blackouts, shutting down the country from the rest of the world.
<br><br>
The rights and safety of Bangladeshis are at serious risk and immediate action is needed to hold the authorities to account.
<br><br>
<b><u>What can you do to help? </u></b>
Sign the petition now and demand from authorities that the rights of Bangladeshis are protected, those arbitrarily arrested are released, and that security forces are held to acocunt.
<br><br>
Join us in calling on the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina to:
<br><br>
End the crackdown on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
Conduct a thorough, effective, independent and impartial investigation into the deaths and hold the perpetrators accountable.
Urgently lift the “shoot on sight” curfew orders and the blanket ban on protests.
Immediately release all those who have been arrested solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
