        <h2><b><u>BENNY AND THE BLUE BALOON</u></b></h2>
        <p><i>
            Benny was a little bird with a big imagination. He lived in a cozy nest high up in a maple tree, where the wind rustled the leaves like whispers and the sun painted golden patterns on the bark. Benny loved watching the clouds drift by, wondering what it would be like to fly beyond them—to explore the sky, meet the stars, and maybe even visit the Moon.
        <br><br>One morning, while hopping through the meadow, Benny spotted something strange tangled in the grass. It was round, shiny, and bright blue. Curious, he tugged at the string with his beak. To his surprise, the object floated up gently—it was a balloon! Benny had never seen anything like it. He flapped his wings and grabbed the string tightly. The balloon lifted him off the ground.
        <br><br>Up, up, up Benny soared! Past the tallest trees, past the fluffy clouds, and into a sky filled with wonders. He floated by a castle made of cotton candy clouds, where giggling cloud creatures waved at him. He zoomed past a flock of flying fish that shimmered like rainbows. Benny laughed with delight, his feathers tickled by the breeze.
        Then, he reached the Moon. It was round and glowing, with a sleepy smile and twinkling eyes. “Would you like some tea?” the Moon asked kindly. Benny nodded, and they sat together on a silver cloud, sipping moonberry tea and sharing stories. Benny told the Moon about his nest, his forest friends, and his dream of flying high. The Moon listened patiently, smiling with every word.
        <br><br>But soon, the balloon began to wobble. Benny looked down and saw the Earth far below. It was time to go home. He waved goodbye to the Moon, who gave him a wink and a sprinkle of stardust for the journey.
        <br><br>As Benny floated back down, the sky slowly turned golden. He landed softly in the meadow, where all his forest friends had gathered. They cheered and chirped, eager to hear about his adventure. Benny told them everything—the cloud castle, the flying fish, the Moon’s tea party. Their eyes sparkled with wonder.
        <br><br>That night, Benny sat in his nest, gazing up at the stars. He felt warm and happy, not just because of the adventure, but because he had shared it. He knew he’d fly again someday. And next time, he’d bring his friends along—because the sky was even more magical when it was shared.

    <h2><b><u>LULU THE LADYBUG'S LOST SPOTS</u></b></h2>
    <p><i>
        Lulu was the brightest ladybug in the garden. Her red shell sparkled in the sunlight, and her six black spots were perfectly round and shiny. Every morning, she twirled on the petals, humming cheerful tunes while her friends admired her beauty. Lulu loved her spots—they made her feel special.
    <br><br>But one morning, Lulu woke up and gasped. Her spots were gone! Her shell was plain red, without a single dot. She rubbed her eyes and looked again—still no spots. “Oh no,” she whispered. “What will everyone think?”
    <br><br>Feeling shy, Lulu tiptoed through the garden, hiding behind leaves and petals. She didn’t want anyone to see her like this. As she crept past the pond, she heard soft sobbing. It was Coco the caterpillar, crying beside a broken twig.
    <br><br>“My bridge is gone,” Coco sniffled. “I can’t get back to my leaf.”
    <br><br>Lulu forgot about her missing spots and flew over. “Don’t worry, I’ll help!” She gathered tiny sticks and built a new bridge for Coco. “Thank you!” Coco beamed. As Lulu flew away, something magical happened—a single black spot appeared on her shell.
    <br><br>Later, she saw Benny the beetle struggling to carry a crumb. “Let me help you,” Lulu said, lifting the crumb with ease. Another spot appeared.
    <br><br>All day long, Lulu helped her friends. She found a lost button for a shy spider, cheered up a sleepy snail, and sang lullabies to baby bugs. With each kind act, a spot returned. By sunset, all six spots were back, shining brighter than ever.
    <br><br>Lulu twirled in the golden light, not because she wanted to be admired, but because she felt proud of her heart. Her friends gathered around and cheered—not for her spots, but for her kindness.
    <br><br>From that day on, Lulu wore her spots with joy. They weren’t just decorations—they were reminders of the love she shared.
